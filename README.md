# Dogs and Cats classifier
This is my very first Deep Learning project. I've implemented CNN model to classify dogs and cats from images.
The project was created during the summer of 2019 and since then have been used several times as part of other personal project.
Now (October 2020) I have decided to upload the code publicly.

In The image below you can see a classifiction done using C# Client
